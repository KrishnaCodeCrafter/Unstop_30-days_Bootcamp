## Problem Statement

In a distant galaxy, a young inventor named Leo created a robot called "Trace" to help him find hidden treasures. These treasures were marked on ancient maps stored as long strings of mysterious text. To locate a treasure, Trace needed to find a specific clue called the Key, made up of a unique combination of characters.

The maps were massive and full of random symbols, making Traceâ€™s task difficult. The Key could appear in any part of the map, but its characters might be jumbled. Traceâ€™s job was to find the shortest section(substring) of the map that included all the characters of the Key, no matter the order.  If no such substring exists, Trace should return -1.

## Input Format

- The first line contains a string S representing the map.

- The second line contains a string T representing the Key.

## Output Format

- Output the length of the shortest substring of s that contains all the characters of t in any order. If no such substring exists, output -1.

---

## Constraints

- **Each character of S and T is a printable ASCII character.**
- **1 â‰¤ |S| â‰¤ |T| â‰¤ 10<sup>5</sup>**

---

## Sample Testcase 0

**Input:**
```bash
warrmioruhk
warrior
```

**Output:**
```bash
8
```

### Explanation

The shortest substring of S that contains all the characters of T is "warrmior", which has length 8.

## Sample Testcase 1

**Input:**
```bash
Thunder
King
```

**Output:**
```bash
-1
```

### Explanation

There is no substring of S that contains all the characters of T.

---

## Solution (C++)

```cpp

#include "bits/stdc++.h"
using namespace std;

int shortest_substring(const string& s, const string& t) {
    int n = s.size();
    int left=0;
    int minLen = INT_MAX;
    int right = 0;
    vector<int> freq(128,0);
    for(auto &x:t){
        freq[x]++;
    }
    int cnt = t.size();
    while(right < n){
        char r_ch = s[right];
        if(freq[r_ch] > 0){
            cnt--;
        }
        freq[r_ch]--;
        while(cnt == 0){
            minLen = min(minLen,right-left+1);
            char l_ch = s[left];
            freq[l_ch]++;
            if(freq[l_ch] > 0){
                cnt++;
            }
            left++;
        }
        right++;
    }
    if(minLen != INT_MAX)
        return minLen;
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    string s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    int result = shortest_substring(s, t);
    cout << result << endl;
    return 0;
}


```


Happy coding! ðŸš€
