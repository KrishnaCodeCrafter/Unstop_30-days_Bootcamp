## Problem Statement

Given a n * m matrix of ones and zeros, where 0 denotes water and 1 denotes island, now you have to count the total number of square submatrices that consist entirely of 1s. 

## Input Format
 
- First line contains n and m, where n is the number of rows and m is the column.
- From second line it contains the elements of the arr matrix.

## Output Format

- Print the count of the number of square sub-island.

## Constraints
- **1 ≤ arr.length ≤ 300**  
- **1 ≤ arr[0].length ≤ 300**  
- **1 ≤ arr[i][j] ≤ 1**

## Sample Testcase 0

**Input:**
```bash
3 3
1 0 1
1 1 0
1 1 1
```

**Output:**
```bash
8
```

### Explanation

There are 7 squares of side 1.<br>
There are 1 squares of side 2.<br>
There is  0 square of side 3.<br>
Total number of squares = 7 + 1 + 0 = 8.

## Sample Testcase 1

**Input:**
```bash
3 3
1 0 1
1 1 0
1 1 0
```

**Output:**
```bash
7
```

### Explanation

There are 6 squares of side 1.  <br>
There is 1 square of side 2. <br>
Total number of squares = 6 + 1 = 7.
