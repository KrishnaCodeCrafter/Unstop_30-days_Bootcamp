## Problem Statement

In a peaceful village, the wise sage decided to introduce a new challenge at the annual harvest festival. He handed out numbered stones to the villagers and told them the task: find pairs of stones such that each numbers were divisible by either of two special numbers, N and M.

The villagers quickly grouped the stones, checking which ones met the criteria. They worked together, carefully pairing up the stones that were divisible by either N or M, making sure no pair was repeated and a pair must contain different stone.

By the end of the day, they had discovered several unique pairs, and the sage was pleased with their effort and the count they got.

## Input Format

- The first line contains an integer 'n' representing the number of nodes in the linked liThe first line contains three space-separated integers P, N, and M, where P is the number of stones in the village and N and M are the special numbers used to identify lucky stones.

- The second line contains P space-separated integers, each representing the number on a stone.

## Output Format

- Output a single integer representing the number of pairs the villagers got at the end of the day.

## Constraints

- **1 â‰¤ P â‰¤ 10<sup>3</sup>**  
- **1 â‰¤ N,M â‰¤ 10<sup>5</sup>**  
- **1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 10<sup>5</sup>**  
- **duplicate numbers are treated as different as they are present on different stones.**

## Sample Testcase 0

**Input:**
```bash
5 2 3
6 9 12 15 18
```

**Output:**
```bash
10
```

### Explanation

The valid pairs of stone, where the each number is divisible by either 2 or 3 are (6,9); (6,12); (6,15); (6,18); (9,12); (9,15); (9,18); (12,15); (12,18) and (15,18). The count is 10.

## Sample Testcase 1

**Input:**
```bash
4 4 4
2 5 5 8 
```

**Output:**
```bash
0
```

### Explanation

No valid pair found.

## Solution (C++)

```cpp
#include "bits/stdc++.h"
using namespace std;

int find_lucky_stone_pairs(int p, int n, int m, vector<int>& stones) {
    int pair = 0;
    for(int i=0;i<p-1;i++){
        if(stones[i]%n == 0 || stones[i]%m == 0){
            for(int j=i+1;j<p;j++){
                if(stones[j]%n == 0 || stones[j]%m == 0)
                    pair++;
            }
        }
    }

    return pair;
}

int main() {
    int p, n, m;
    cin >> p >> n >> m;
    vector<int> stones(p);
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        cin >> stones[i];
    }
    int result = find_lucky_stone_pairs(p, n, m, stones);
    cout << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```


Happy coding! ðŸš€
