## Problem Statement

In a distant galaxy, a young inventor named Leo created a robot called "Trace" to help him find hidden treasures. These treasures were marked on ancient maps stored as long strings of mysterious text. To locate a treasure, Trace needed to find a specific clue called the Key, made up of a unique combination of characters.

The maps were massive and full of random symbols, making Traceâ€™s task difficult. The Key could appear in any part of the map, but its characters might be jumbled. Traceâ€™s job was to find the shortest section(substring) of the map that included all the characters of the Key, no matter the order.  If no such substring exists, Trace should return -1.

## Input Format

- The first line contains a string S representing the map.

- The second line contains a string T representing the Key.

## Output Format

- Output the length of the shortest substring of s that contains all the characters of t in any order. If no such substring exists, output -1.

---

## Constraints

- **Each character of S and T is a printable ASCII character.**
- **1 â‰¤ |S| â‰¤ |T| â‰¤ 10<sup>5</sup>**

## Sample Testcase 0

**Input:**
```bash
warrmioruhk
warrior
```

**Output:**
```bash
8
```

### Explanation

The shortest substring of S that contains all the characters of T is "warrmior", which has length 8.

## Sample Testcase 1

**Input:**
```bash
Thunder
King
```

**Output:**
```bash
-1
```

### Explanation

There is no substring of S that contains all the characters of T.
