## Problem Statement

Jack enjoys playing his favorite game, Enemy Exodus, which features N groups of enemies, with the i-th group containing group[i]  enemies.<br>
There's a critical point in the game: after M minutes, the enemies activate a super shield headquarters that makes them invulnerable. Jack knows this and wants to eliminate all enemies before the shield is activated.<br>
Each minute, he can decide on a kill rate K, which represents the number of enemies he will attempt to kill from a chosen group. If a group has fewer than K enemies, he will kill all remaining enemies in that group for that minute. Jack prefers to kill enemies slowly but must still finish off all of them before the shield activates.<br>
The task is to determine the minimum integer value of K that allows him to kill all enemies within the M minutes and convert this value into octal format.

## Input Format

- Each test case consists of three lines of input.
- The first line contains the integer N, representing the number of groups of enemies.
- The second line includes Nspace-separated integers, representing the number of enemies in each group.
- The third line provides the integer M, indicating the number of minutes Jack has before the enemies activate their shield.

## Output Format

- Print the minimum integer K followed by K in an octal number. If no such min value exists, print 1.

## Constraints

- **1<=N<=10<sup>4</sup>**
- **N<=M<=10<sup>6</sup>**
- **1<=group[i]<=10<sup>6</sup>**

## Sample Testcase 0

**Input:**
```bash
4 
3 6 7 11
8
```

**Output:**
```bash 
4 4
```

### Explanation

The lower index value here is 4, which, when converted to octal, gives 4

## Sample Testcase 1

**Input:**
```bash
5 
30 11 23 4 20
5
```

**Output:**
```bash
30 36
```
### Explanation

The minimum value here is 30, which, when converted to octal, gives 36
