## Problem Statement

You are given two sorted arrays a1 and a2 of size m and n respectively. Now we combine the values of these two arrays to make a mega array. The resulting mega array is also sorted in nature.

Your task is to find the median of this mega array.

## Input Format

- Each Input has three lines, containing space-separated integers.
- The first line contains 2 values m and n respectively.
- The second line contains m numbers that signify nums1.
- The third line contains n numbers that signify nums2.

## Output Format

- Return a Double data type number which is the median of two arrays.

---

## Constraints

- **nums1.length == m**
- **nums2.length == n**
- **0 <= m <= 10^6**
- **0 <= n <= 10^6**

## Sample Testcase 0

**Input:**
```bash
2 1
1 3
2
```

**Output:**
```bash
2.0
```

### Explanation

Resulting array:- [1,2,3]<br>
Median of this array is 2.00000.

## Sample Testcase 1

**Input:**
```bash
2 2
1 3
2 4
```

**Output:**
```bash
2.5
```
### Explanation

Resulting array:- [1,2,3,4]<br>
Median of this array is ((2+3)/2) = 2.50000.
