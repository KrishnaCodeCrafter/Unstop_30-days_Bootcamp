## Problem Statement

Sid is reading a paragraph of a story and notices N different sentences. He's curious to know which sentence is the longest.

Help Sid find the length of the longest sentence in the story. Sentences are separated by a comma(,) or a dot (.) no other symbols are used except comma or dot .

## Input Format

- The first line of input contains a string where sentences are separated by commas ( ,) or dot (.)  .

## Output Format

- Display a single integer, that denotes the length of the longest sentence.

## Constraints

- **1<=N<=20**

## Sample Testcase 0

**Input:**
```bash
Ram is a good boy. He drinks a lot of water. He stays in Shimla.
```

**Output:**
```bash 
6
```

### Explanation

Here are three sentences:


1. "Ram is a good boy" (length = 5 words)
2. "He drinks a lot of water" (length = 6 words)
3. "He stays in Shimla" (length = 4 words)


The second sentence is the longest, with a length of 6 words, so we print 6.

## Sample Testcase 1

**Input:**
```bash
Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.
```

**Output:**
```bash
11
```
### Explanation

Here are two sentences:


1. "Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy" (length = 11 words)
2. "wealthy and wise" (length = 3 words)

## Solution (C++)

```cpp

#include "bits/stdc++.h"
using namespace std;

int user_logic(string s) {
    int ans = 0;
    int cnt = 1;
    for(int i=0;i<s.size();i++){
        if(s[i] == ' '){
            cnt++;
        }else if(s[i] == '.' || s[i] == ','){
            ans = max(ans,cnt);
            i++;
            cnt = 1;
        }
    }

    return ans;
}

int main() {
    string s;
    getline(cin, s);
    
    // Call user logic function and print the output
    int result = user_logic(s);
    cout << result << endl;
    return 0;
}

```


Happy coding! 🚀
