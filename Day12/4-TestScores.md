## Problem Statement

The exam scores for a class of N students have been released. The marks obtained by each student are stored in an array of scores[], where scores[i] represent the marks of the ith student.

As the class monitor, Ram is tasked with answering queries from the teacher. The teacher will ask Q queries, and for each query, Ram needs to determine how many students have scored at least X marks.

Your objective is to help Ram by finding the number of students who have scored at least X marks for each query.

## Input Format

- The first line contains two positive integers N, and Q, denoting the number of students and the number of queries, respectively.

- This is followed by a line containing N integers, separated by space giving the scores of each student.

- Then, Q lines follow where the ith line contains a single integer X.
 

## Output Format

- For each query, print a single integer representing the number of students who scored at least X marks.

## Constraints

- **1 <= N, Q <= 2 * 10<sup>5</sup>**
- **1 <= X <= 10<sup>9</sup>**
- **1 <= scores[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>**

## Sample Testcase 0

**Input:**
```bash
5 2
1 4 12 3 9
2
15
```

**Output:**
```bash 
4
0
```

### Explanation

There are 5 students with scores [1, 4, 12, 3, 9].

The first query asks for the number of students who scored at least 2 marks. The students with scores [4, 12, 3, 9] meet this criterion, resulting in 4 students.

The second query asks for the number of students who scored at least 15 marks. No student meets this criterion, resulting in 0 students.<br>
Therefore, the outputs are 4 and 0 respectively.


## Sample Testcase 1

**Input:**
```bash
4 1
2 3 1 4 
3
```

**Output:**
```bash
2
```
### Explanation

There are 4 students with scores [2, 3, 1, 4].<br>
The query asks for the number of students who scored at least 3 marks.<br>
The students with scores of 3 and 4 meet this criterion.<br>
Therefore, the output is 2.

## Solution (C++)

```cpp

#include "bits/stdc++.h"
using namespace std;

int solve(vector<int>& scores,int x){
    int low = 0;
    int high = scores.size()-1;
    int ans = -1;
    while(low <= high){
        int mid = low + (high - low)/2;
        if(x <= scores[mid]){
            ans = mid;
            low = mid+1;
        }else{
            high = mid-1;
        }
    }
    return ans+1;
}

vector<int> user_logic(int n, int q, vector<int>& scores, vector<int>& queries) {
    vector<int> results;    
    sort(scores.rbegin(),scores.rend());

    for(auto& x:queries){
        results.push_back(solve(scores,x));
    }

    return results;
}

int main() {
    int n, q;
    cin >> n >> q;
    vector<int> scores(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> scores[i];
    }
    vector<int> queries(q);
    for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
        cin >> queries[i];
    }
    vector<int> results = user_logic(n, q, scores, queries);
    for (int result : results) {
        cout << result << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}

```
